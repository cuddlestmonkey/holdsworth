	* algorithm.cpp, chunk.cpp, chunk.h, debugging.cpp, engine.cpp, engine.h, handmodel.cpp, handmodelx.cpp, instrumentdefn.cpp, instrumentdefn.h, note.cpp, note.h, types.h, vn_algorithm.cpp:
	Support a pure STL interface into the library, so that non-QT apps can use it.

2006-06-11  Vince Negri  <vn@pankot>

	* engine.cpp, engine.h:
	Initial position had an incorrect aversion for 7th fret!
	Also improve initial position selection heuristic.

2006-04-14  Vince Negri  <vn@pankot>

	* constraints.h, engine.cpp:
	Start using the Constraints class for sundry options.

	* chunk.cpp, debugging.cpp, engine.cpp, note.cpp, types.h, vn_algorithm.cpp:
	Clean up some literal strings

	* engine.cpp, note.cpp, note.h:
	Optimisation: short-cut to the next pass when we hit a restart point
	and an auto-hint has already been inserted.

2006-04-03  Vince Negri  <vn@pankot>

	* chunk.h, constraints.h, engine.h, instrumentdefn.cpp, instrumentdefn.h, note.h, types.h:
	Merge in changes to allow QT4 build

2006-04-02  Vince Negri  <vn@pankot>

	* engine.cpp:
	Allow start of notes and start of free chunk to be hinted (prefer high/low position)
	Make inhibition of back-to-back gliss smarter, and optional.

	* note.cpp, note.h:
	Expose hint status of a note in a more encapsulated way
	(will help later when we change to a bitmask for speed)

	* vn_algorithm.cpp: cleanup

	* engine.cpp: Make quiet mode a command-line option
	Try to avoid inserting pointless autohints when they are unlikely to help
	Don't purge autohints past a "=" (start again) annotation.

2006-04-01  Vince Negri  <vn@pankot>

	* vn_algorithm.cpp:
	Always start afresh at a "=" hint. Otherwise a demented fingering that nevertheless allows
	a run through the "=" may get preferred.

	* vn_algorithm.cpp:
	Spot slide opportunities when shifting down as well as up.

	* vn_algorithm.cpp:
	Make sure repeated notes are always played with a single fingering.
	This avoids strange fingerings in some cases.

	* vn_algorithm.cpp: Improve evaluation of LH shift methods.

	* engine.cpp: Enable status output to be supressed.

	* handmodel.cpp, handmodel.h, vn_algorithm.cpp:
	Move the static finger/stretch penalties into HandModel where they belong.

	* engine.cpp, engine.h:
	Allow the max LH shift to be set as a parameter.

	* vn_algorithm.cpp:
	Try out penalty that catches nasty LH stretches when changing position.

	* engine.cpp: Change the smallest autohintable chunk.
	Allow autohinting to reach back through model-enforced position changes (not manual hints)

	* vn_algorithm.cpp: Clean up some comments and magic numbers

	* engine.cpp, engine.h:
	Break out hint up/ hint down weightings to protected virtual functions.
	Makes life easier for others to experiment with the auto-hint function.

	* engine.h: add test harness options

	* algorithm.h, engine.cpp, note.h, vn_algorithm.cpp, vn_algorithm.h:
	Merge in lead-in note changes

2006-03-28  Vince Negri  <vn@pankot>

	* engine.cpp: Try different weightings when using hinted shifts

	* algorithm.h, chunk.h, constraints.h, debugging.h, engine.h, handmodel.h, handmodelx.h, instrumentdefn.h, note.h, types.h, vn_algorithm.h, chunk.cpp, debugging.cpp, engine.cpp, handmodel.cpp, handmodelx.cpp, instrumentdefn.cpp, note.cpp, vn_algorithm.cpp, algorithm.cpp:
	New file.
