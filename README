README for Holdsworth snapshot
==============================

To build the test program:
--------------------------

1) qmake

[On a Mac you probably want to use "qmake -spec macx-g++" to create a Makefile]

2) make

This will create the "fing" executable.
Run "fing" (no parameters needed); an output file "output.ly"
is created. Then run Lilypond on that file.

To change the notes input into the engine, check out  "fing --help"


To build documentation:
-----------------------

Run "doxygen" from the same directory as the provided Doxyfile.
